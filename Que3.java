 * Ans:-
 * The main advantage of testNG can be listed as follows:

    TestNG provides parallel execution of test methods
    It allows to define dependency of one test method over other method
    It allows to assign priority to test methods
    It allows grouping of test methods into test groups
    It has support for parameterizing test cases using @Parameters annotation
    It allows data driven testing using @DataProvider annotation
    It has different assertions that helps in checking the expected and actual results
    Detailed (HTML) reports
    
    Testng annotations is basically organized out testcase according 
    to their name and function,and it help to recognize out testcase 
    on different level like suit ,test ,class , method etc.
    
    it also help the providing data to our credentials and all.
    and separate test case in well manner.
